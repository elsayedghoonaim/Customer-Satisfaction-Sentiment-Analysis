# Customer Satisfaction Analysis using NLTK

This project is part of the **Python NLTK for Beginners: Customer Satisfaction Analysis** course on Coursera. The project involves analyzing customer reviews to determine satisfaction levels, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a particular focus on the **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library in Python.

## Introduction

Customer satisfaction is an essential metric for businesses to understand user sentiment and improve their services. This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze customer reviews and categorize them as positive, neutral, or negative. The project employs NLTK for text preprocessing, tokenization, sentiment analysis, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project include:
- Text preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing customer review text data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Using NLTK tools to analyze and classify the sentiment of each review.
- Visualizations: Representing sentiment distribution and key insights for customer satisfaction.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - NLTK
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn (optional for advanced text preprocessing or additional analysis)

You can install the libraries by running:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-satisfaction-analysis.git
    cd customer-satisfaction-analysis
    ```
2. Download and prepare the dataset (see the Dataset section below).

3. Install the required libraries (as listed in the Requirements section).

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and execute the cells to perform customer satisfaction analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes customer reviews and their satisfaction ratings. The dataset file should be in a CSV format and contain fields like:
- `Review`: The text of the customer's review.
- `Rating` or `Sentiment`: The rating or sentiment assigned by the customer (e.g., positive, neutral, or negative).

Ensure that your dataset is saved in the same directory as the project notebook, or update the file path accordingly in the code.

## Project Structure

- `Customer_Satisfaction_Analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the code and explanations for performing the analysis.
- `data/`: Folder where the dataset file should be placed.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

1. Open `Customer_Satisfaction_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in each cell to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the text reviews.
   - Visualize the results and interpret key insights.

## Results

The project outputs visualizations and metrics showing customer satisfaction distribution and identifying common positive and negative feedback themes. This information can help improve business services and understand customer needs.
